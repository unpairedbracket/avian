/// A [`SystemParam`] for the *move and slide* algorithm, also known as *collide and slide* or *step slide*.
///
/// Move and slide is the core movement and collision algorithm used by most kinematic character controllers.
/// It attempts to move a shape along a desired velocity vector, sliding along any colliders that are hit on the way.
///
/// # Algorithm
///
/// At a high level, the algorithm works as follows:
///
/// 1. Sweep the shape along the desired velocity vector.
/// 2. If no collision is detected, move the full distance.
/// 3. If a collision is detected:
///    - Move up to the point of collision.
///    - Project the remaining velocity onto the contact surfaces to obtain a new sliding velocity.
/// 4. Repeat with the new sliding velocity until movement is complete.
///
/// The algorithm also includes depenetration passes before and after movement to improve stability
/// and ensure that the shape does not intersect any colliders.
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// [`MoveAndSlideConfig`] allows configuring various aspects of the algorithm.
/// See its documentation for more information.
///
/// Additionally, [`move_and_slide`](MoveAndSlide::move_and_slide) can be given a callback that is called
/// for each contact surface that is detected during movement. This allows for custom handling of collisions,
/// such as triggering events, or modifying movement based on specific colliders.
///
/// # Other Utilities
///
/// In addition to the main `move_and_slide` method, this system parameter also provides utilities for:
///
/// - Performing shape casts optimized for movement via [`cast_move`](MoveAndSlide::cast_move).
/// - Depenetrating shapes that are intersecting colliders via [`depenetrate`](MoveAndSlide::depenetrate).
/// - Performing intersection tests via [`intersections`](MoveAndSlide::intersections).
/// - Projecting velocities to slide along contact planes via [`project_velocity`](MoveAndSlide::project_velocity).
///
/// These methods are used internally by the move and slide algorithm, but can also be used independently
/// for custom movement and collision handling.
///
/// # Resources
///
/// Some useful resources for learning more about the move and slide algorithm include:
///

    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// - `shape`: The shape that intersections are tested against represented as a [`Collider`].
    /// - `shape_position`: The position of the shape.
    /// - `shape_rotation`: The rotation of the shape.
    /// - `filter`: A [`SpatialQueryFilter`] that determines which colliders are taken into account in the query.
    /// - `prediction_distance`: An extra margin applied to the [`Collider`].
    /// - `callback`: A callback that is called for each intersection found. The callback receives the deepest contact point and the contact normal.
    ///   Returning `false` will stop further processing of intersections.
