# Migrating From v0.4 to `main`

This file contains migration guides for breaking changes that have happened on the `main` branch
since the latest release. These guides are evolving and may not be polished yet.

See [migration-guides/README.md](./README.md) and existing entries for information about Avian's
migration guide process and what to put here.

## `ReadRigidBody` and `WriteRigidBody`

PR [#908](https://github.com/avianphysics/avian/pull/908) introduced two new traits: `ReadRigidBody` and `WriteRigidBody`, and `RigidyBodyForces` is now defined as:

```rust
pub trait RigidBodyForces: ReadRigidBodyForces + WriteRigidBodyForces {}
```

In most cases this should just work, but if it doesn't, you can replace your implementation for `RigidBodyForces` with both `ReadRigidBodyForces` and `WriteRigidBodyForces` where it is used / needed. Both traits are required to implement `RigidBodyForces`, but you can implement them separately.
